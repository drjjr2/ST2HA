<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>My basic motivation for switching to Home Assistant stemmed from the fact that I no longer wanted to pay for my home security system. And, it turns out, that some of the components that I bought 3+ years ago as part of the system were Z-Wave which I was able to successfully move from the security system to SmartThings.<br>
But recreating an alarm system using SmartThings was not super intuitive. My original plan of reusing an old Kindle Fire 7 and installing ActionTiles and using that as my panel was not successful. I would conservatively say that 1 out of every 6 days I would walk in to see the panel say “Connecting.” So finally one morning when I went to disarm my system and it said “Connecting” I went on a quest.</p>
<p>My background is 20 years in system-level BIOS development. Twelve years ago, that drove me to drink so I opened a restaurant. There’s not a lot of coding there but it did give me another venue to turn into a smart “home” with automated lighting.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I do not have a background in Linux, dockers, JSON, YAML, MQTT, Z-Wave protocols, GitHub, or anything else that I’ve scratched the surface of in the past few weeks. But I can grasp the concepts which will be important if you need to go off the beaten path for any customizations or oddball devices or use cases you might have.</p>
