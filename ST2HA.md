<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>My basic motivation for switching to Home Assistant stemmed from the fact that I no longer wanted to pay for my home security system. And, it turns out, that some of the components that I bought 3+ years ago as part of the system were Z-wave which I was able to successfully move from the security system to SmartThings.<br>
But recreating an alarm system using SmartThings was not super intuitive. My original plan of reusing an old Kindle Fire 7 and installing ActionTiles was not successful. I would conservatively say that 1 out of every 6 days I would walk in to see the panel say “Connecting”</p>

<p>Like many who are switching, I wanted local control for my panel and devices. I frequent Reddit and there have been a lot of conversations about Home Assistant.</p>

<p>Simply put, we couldn’t find the Raspberry Pi I bought a year or so ago in a vain attempt to build a classic video game cabinet. A flood and a hurricane later and that board was lost to the wind. I had no sooner ordered the Raspberry Pi 4 from Amazon than I stumbled across this Youtube video detailing how to install Home Assistant in a VM on a PC using Oracle VirtualBox.<br>
I’ll leave it up to you to follow the instructions there. I also set a static IP, the instructons for which are in this video.</p>

<p>My automated home has been pieced together over the years since the moment we got an Amazon Echo. This means it is a disparate selection of devices including:<br>
3 WeMo on/off switches</p>
<p>ZWave<br>
Zigbee<br>
Alexa</p>
