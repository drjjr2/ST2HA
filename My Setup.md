<h2 id="my-original-smartthings-setup">My Original SmartThings Setup</h2>
<p>My automated home has been pieced together over the years since the moment we got an Amazon Echo. This means it is a disparate collection of devices including:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3 WeMo on/off switches<br>
5 Kwikset 910 Keypad Locks<br>
2 Linear GD00Z-4 Garage Door Openers<br>
2 Ecolink Door/Window Sensors<br>
7 GE 14291 on/off switches<br>
6 GE 12722 on/off switches<br>
8 GE 12724 dimmer switches<br>
1 GE 14294 dimmer switch<br>
1 Leviton DZ6HD-1BZ dimmer switch<br>
1 Remotec ZFM-80 switch (for the fireplace)<br>
2 Inovelli LZW30 on/off switches<br>
2 Inovelli NZW31 on/off switches<br>
1 Inovelli NZW30 on/off switch<br>
1 GE 14287 fan control switch<br>
1 Inovelli NZW31 dimmer<br>
1 ZSE19 S2 Multisiren<br>
12 Zigbee Samsung Multipurpose Sensors (for the windows)<br>
2 Centralite plugs (used for Zigbee repeaters)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also have a Philips Hue hub with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2 Hue blooms<br>
1 Hue light strip<br>
3 Hue white lamps<br>
1 Hue color downlight<br>
7 Hue color lamps</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I made the break from my security company I wanted to be able to use some wired door and window sensors along with a motion detector and siren, so I have a</p>
<blockquote>
<p>6 Zone <a href="http://Konnected.io">Konnected.io</a> alarm panel kit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other things that I have integrated are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two Ecobee thermostats<br>
Rachio sprinkler control<br>
3 Logitech Harmony Hubs<br>
Netatmo weather station<br>
Bond Home to control some ceiling fans<br>
Jandy iAqualink for the pool</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And a partridge in a pear tree.</p>
<p>All of this can be integrated into Home Assistant. Some of it was partially integrated into SmartThings. But mostly I used SmartThings as a conduit to Alexa.</p>
